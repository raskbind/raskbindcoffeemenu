                <p>Cold brew is a refreshing and smooth coffee beverage that has gained popularity in recent years. Unlike traditional hot coffee, cold brew is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in cold water for an extended period, usually overnight. This slow extraction process creates a unique flavor profile that is less acidic and more mellow than regular coffee. The result is a delicious and concentrated coffee concentrate that can be enjoyed over ice or mixed with milk or water to create a variety of cold beverages. Cold brew has become a favorite among coffee enthusiasts, offering a refreshing alternative for those seeking a chilled and less acidic coffee experience.</p>
